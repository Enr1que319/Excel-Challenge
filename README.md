## Introduction

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

In this project a table is provided, the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects was modified and analized

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
- That you have to filter a lot the pivot table to see all the information more specifically, it is hard to compare the information 

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Pie, Waterfall, Histogram
